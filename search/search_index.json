Their coordination hinges on a shared message history, typically managed within a component like <code>MessagesState</code>. This acts as a central ledger of the conversation.</p> <p>Think of it like a meticulously recorded group project chat where everyone sees all messages in the order they were sent. When it's an agent's turn to contribute:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Reads the History: It first accesses the entire current chat history from <code>MessagesState</code>. This gives it full context of everything that has transpired across all participating agents.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performs its Task: The agent then does its designated job, which might involve thinking, calling an LLM, or using a tool.</p> </li> <li> <p>Writes Back: Finally, it appends its own messages (e.g., an <code>AIMessage</code> detailing its findings or actions) to the shared <code>MessagesState</code>, thus adding to the ongoing conversation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This cycle ensures that if Agent A contributes, and then Agent B takes over, Agent B has visibility into the initial request and Agent A's input.

While the next section, \"Tagging Agents in the Flow,\" dives deeper into specific techniques like the <code>name</code> attribute and agent-specific <code>SystemMessage</code>s, the core idea is that each message carries information about its origin and purpose.

Enhancing MultiQuery Retriever with Chat History: Context-Aware Question Generation","text":"<p>In our previous iteration, we already used chat history to provide context for our LLM's responses. However, we've now taken this a step further by incorporating chat history into our MultiQuery Retriever. This enhancement significantly improves the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to context-dependent queries, especially in ongoing conversations.</p> <p>Let's see how this works in practice:</p> <p>Imagine you're having a conversation with your chatbot about your work projects:</p> <p>You: \"What projects did I work on March 1?\" Chatbot: [Provides a response about your March 1 projects]</p> <p>You: \"How about March 2?\"</p> <p>Without context, the MultiQuery Retriever might generate variations like:</p> <ol> <li>\"What happened on March 2?\"</li> <li>\"Events on March 2\"</li> <li>\"March 2 activities\"</li> </ol> <p>These queries, while related to the date, miss the crucial context about projects.</p> <p>However, with our chat history-aware MultiQuery Retriever, it might generate variations like:</p> <ol> <li>\"What projects did I work on March 2?\"</li> <li>\"Project activities on March 2\"</li> <li>\"March 2 project updates\"</li> </ol> <p>These variations are much more likely to retrieve relevant information about your projects on March 2, maintaining the context of your conversation.</p> <p>This improvement is crucial for maintaining coherent, context-aware conversations. Without it, the MultiQuery Retriever could sometimes generate less useful variations, particularly in multi-turn interactions where the context from previous messages is essential.</p> <p>By making the MultiQuery Retriever aware of chat history, we've significantly enhanced its ability to generate relevant query variations. This leads to more accurate document retrieval and, ultimately, more contextually appropriate responses from the chatbot.</p> <p>This enhancement truly brings together the power of our previous improvements. The MultiQuery Retriever now not only casts a wider net with multiple phrasings but does so with an understanding of the conversation's context.

Pinecone's simplicity and quick setup allowed me to focus on building the chatbot's functionality rather than getting bogged down in infrastructure.</p> <p>For the language model, I chose OpenAI's GPT-4, as its advanced reasoning capabilities would simplify the app-building process and reduce the need for extensive preprocessing.</p> <p>The initial chatbot workflow looked like this:</p> <p></p> <p>The first version of the chatbot was decent, but I wanted to find a way to measure its performance and track progress as I iterated. After some research, I discovered the RAGAS framework, which is designed specifically for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems. By creating a dataset with question-answer pairs, I could measure metrics like answer correctness, relevancy, context precision, recall, and faithfulness.</p> <p></p> <p>I included all the metrics available through the RAGAS library, as I was curious to see how they would be affected by my improvements. You can read more about RAGAS metrics here. At this stage, I wasn't sure what to make of the numbers or whether they indicated good or bad performance, but it was a starting point.</p> Metric Base Performance Answer_correctness 0.42 Answer_relevancy 0.39 Answer_similarity 0.84 Context_entity_recall 0.27 Context_precision 0.71 Context_recall 0.43 Context_relevancy 0.01 Faithfulness 0.39","tags":["llm","obsidian-kb"]},{"location":"writing/2024/04/29/building-obsidian-kb-chatbot/#iteration-2-refining-the-approach","title":"Iteration 2: Refining the Approach","text":"<p>With the evaluation framework in place, I reviewed the examples and runs to identify areas for improvement. One thing that stood out was the presence of Dataview queries in my notes. These queries are used in Obsidian to pull data from various notes, similar to SQL queries. However, they don't execute and provide results when the Markdown file is viewed or accessed outside of Obsidian. I realized that these queries might be introducing noise and not adding much value, so I decided to remove them.</p> <p>After making this change and re-evaluating the chatbot, I was surprised to see that the answer metrics had actually gone down. Digging deeper, I discovered that the vector search wasn't yielding the correct daily notes, even for straightforward queries like \"What did I do on March 4, 2024?\" On the bright side, context precision had improved since the context no longer contained Dataview queries.</p> Metric Base Iteration 2 Answer_correctness 0.42 0.34 Answer_relevancy 0.39 0.36 Answer_similarity 0.84 0.81 Context_entity_recall 0.27 0.09 Context_precision 0.71 0.87 Context_recall 0.43 0.42 Context_relevancy 0.01 0.02 Faithfulness 0.39 0.69 <p>To address the issue with vector search, I made two adjustments: 1. Increased the number of documents returned by the retriever from the default 4 to 20. 2. Switched to using a MultiQuery retriever.</p> <p>The goal was to retrieve a larger set of documents, even if their relevancy scores were low, in the hopes that the reranker model would be able to identify and prioritize the most relevant ones.</p> <p>These changes led to a slight improvement in the answer-related metrics compared to the previous iterations. However, the context-related metrics took a hit due to the increased number of documents being considered.
