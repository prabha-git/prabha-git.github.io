# MY Q&A

## Why is the fine-tuned LLM Model is faster?




### Why DSPy compiled program score less than the uncompiled program?

[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wwyCGgKizNZo48IzfKa9m4uMp2SNRBSF#scrollTo=IyjklZsKCxF-)

- Found that chain of thought doesn't give the expected output (gives out blank output) so metric calculation is not meaningful.

- So make sure DSPy lm model is producing expected output.
