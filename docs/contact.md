I work with fast growing startups who are looking to invest in their applied ai work. If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out me via [email](mailto:jason+work@jxnl.co) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/jxnlco). I'm currently fully booked until March 2024.

If you have general questions for me trying something new, so just [make an issue](https://github.com/jxnl/blog/issues) and tag it with `question`. I'll try to answer it in a blog post.

I'm also available for speaking engagements. If you're interested in having me speak at your event or podcast, please reach out via [email](mailto:jason+speaking@jxnl.co) as well.
